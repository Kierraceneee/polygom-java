# The Polygon Project

This project utilizes the Polygon shapes as a roadmap for utilizing basic Object-Oriented Principles using the Java 
Language. While the Java target will vary between Java 20 and 21, the scope of the code is utilizing Java 8. 

---

This project covers the following concepts:

### Abstraction
- The base class:
  - Polygon
- The first child:
  - Quadrilateral
  - Triangle
- Interface: Height

### Encapsulation
- Each class utilizes this core OOP with private instance variables.
- Each class, where appropriate, utilize read only methods.
- Each class, where appropriate, utilize constructor based setting of variables.

### Inheritance
- First Layer Children
  - Quadrilateral
  - Triangle
  - Hexagon
  - Pentagon
  - Trapezoid
- Second Layer Children
  - Equilateral
  - Isosceles
  - Parallelogram
  - Rectangle
  - Scalene
  - Square

### Polymorphism
- Each class, where appropriate, utilized the keywords **super** and **this**.
- Each class, where appropriate, utilized Runtime Polymorphism to implement the proper formulas.

### Formulas
The equations used for this project utilized the Math class where appropriate. The String Format method was utilized 
for refining the results to 2 decimal points.

### Style
This project utilized a basic MVC style, while utilizing a command prompt / console type output. The output was done 
withing the Controller class rather than the Main, for simplicity.
